      "In the beginning the Breath spoke, and there was Light.",
      "And the Light parted the Darkness, yet did not unmake it.",
      "The Darkness remained behind the firmament, a waiting abyss men call the Veil.",
      "The Breath ordered measure and season; the Veil desired unmaking.",
      "The Breath warmed clay and taught it to sing; the Veil answered with silence.",
      "The Maker saw the Light and named it good, and the Darkness He left unnamed.",
      "From that day, all things would choose: to breathe—or to listen."

      "Eden was fashioned between Heaven and Earth, a continent without hunger or age.",
      "There the Firstborn, called Eldran, walked with men and with angels.",
      "Their craft bound stone and star; their wisdom carved laws into living rock.",
      "No death dwelt in Eden, for the Breath watered every heart.",
      "And yet the Veil pressed against the rim of the world like a tide at night.",
      "The Eldran heard a question in the hush: Why should you not?",
      "Thus began the counsel of ruin."

      "Eve turned her gaze into the Deep; Adam stood and did not speak.",
      "The Eldran raised a spire with roots in the Veil and a crown toward Heaven.",
      "They named it Va, a bridge of stone and soul, to drink what was forbidden.",

      "Then the Angels descended, weeping iron and fire.",
      "The Tower broke, and Eden was sealed from the sons of clay.",
      "The shards of paradise rained upon the earth; the Sundering began."

    { "chapter": 4, "verses": [
      "The Eldran split as rock along a fault: Mystics to the forests, Artificers to the deeps.",
      "The Mystics became Elves—immortal, beautiful, and dying from within.",
      "The Artificers became Dwarves—heavy-boned, sealed and steadfast under weight.",
      "Men were left with tears and the Breath, frail as candles in wind.",
      "Ogres remained—vats’ children, war-made from stolen boys and dark serums.",
      "The Veil crept into beast and man, and the world learned fear."

      "The Breath mends what it names; the Veil unmakes what it touches.",
      "To drink the Breath is to remember; to draw the Veil is to forget.",
      "The path of light wounds pride; the path of shadow flatters hunger.",
      "Abel’s blood cried like a bell in the dusk, and men heard it faintly.",
      "When the Breath returns to many hearts, Eden’s seal shall loosen.",
      "Until that day, choose, and pay the price of your choosing."
