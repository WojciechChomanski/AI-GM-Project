# Midnight at the Guildhall — The Bricking Rite

**Beats:**  
1) **Rotations:** Guards change every ten minutes. Lanterns flare and dim.  
2) **The Circle:** Chains laid; chalk lines in three strokes; ward-mesh lanterns hooded.  
3) **Asha:** Shaved head, iron-branded tongue. Hums a psalm between chains.  
4) **Choice:** Confessor cell at the stair; Gallows proxy in the shadow; Threll at the keystone.  
5) **Cant or Seal:** Two minutes of “ELI” mutes the scream. Ten minutes seals it forever.  
6) **Break or Bury:** Save Asha with sabotage… or finish the wall and end the whispers.

**Sensory:**  
- Stone sweats. The chalk tastes like bone. When the chain crosses the glyph, breath fog curls toward the ceiling like a fleeing ghost.
