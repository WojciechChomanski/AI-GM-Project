# Stonewarden Loadouts v0.6b

Three ready-to-play loadouts. All nonmagical; uses pre-inscribed plates, legit powder work, and repeater discipline.

## Anvil (Tank / Hold Line)
**Use when:** You must anchor a choke or soak pushes.  
**Core:** 2× Anvil plates, 1× Mesh plate, spikes, coil wires, short repeater.  
**Openers:**
- Enter **Anvil Stance** adjacent to the lane head.
- Drop **Mesh** behind you; pull **coil wire** as you advance 1–2 m.
- **Blast Shield Drill** before any friendly charge dets nearby.
**Swap out:** One coil for an extra mag if the scene is ranged-heavy.

## Thunder Sapper (Breach / Boom)
**Use when:** Doors, gates, cart-spans, or tunnel collars must go.  
**Core:** Shaped + Breach charges, Runic fuses, rammer, mixed repeater mags.  
**Line of play:**
- **Over-Prime** (risk!) when speed matters.
- Call **Blast Shield Drill** for the team before det.
- If misfire: seat fuse again, swap to **pen mags** for suppression and re-seat.
**Risk:** Misfire range expansion; keep an Anvil buddy nearby.

## Line Marshal (Control / Remote)
**Use when:** You need overwatch triggers and moving difficult terrain.  
**Core:** 2× Mesh, 1× Hybrid plate, 2× Tangle packs, remote trigger.  
**Flow:**
- Place **Ward-Mesh plate**, set **Remote Pin**.
- Establish **Rapid Tangle** in front of melee allies.
- Use **Mesh Overwatch** to pop the field when echoes commit.
**Notes:** Marshal shines in mixed teams; pairs well with Rogues.
