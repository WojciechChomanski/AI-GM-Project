# Stonewarden — Bastion of Kha’in (v0.6a)

**Role:** Tank / Control / Engineer  
**Law:** Male Dwarf only. No Breath, no Veil. Pure tools & physics.  
**Loop:** Set plates → Seat keystones → Seal → Anvil stance → Suppress with repeater → Breach/hold as needed.

## Core Features
- **Anvil Stance (stance):** +15 vs shove/knockdown; Mobility −10. Adjacent allies +5 vs shove.
- **Platework (deploy):** Set Plate → Seat Keystone (TN 45) → Seal & Rivet (TN 50). Uses pre-inscribed plates (made by female runesmiths).
- **Powder Savant (passive):** self explosion damage −25%; allies in your rear arc −10%.
- **Iron Temper (reaction):** spend 5 Stamina to reroll failed Fear/Morale; on success, +5 to resist checks for 1 round.
- **Repeater Arbalest:** 6-bolt mag; burst/strafe risk jamming; clear jam = 1 action.

## Talents (examples)
- **Brace the Line:** Adjacent allies get +5 vs shove while you’re in Anvil.
- **Blast Shield Drill:** Declare before blast; self explosion damage −40% this round.
- **Clean Seat:** Seat Keystone TN −5; +1 minute plate duration on success.
- **Rapid Tangle (mechanical):** 1 action, consume Tangle Line → create 1m difficult terrain for 1 round, then minor hazard persists.

## Paths
**Iron Anvil:** Stonewall Interpose (take ally hit, −1 die), Immovable (negate first forced move/round), **Capstone: Granite Breaker** (first time to 0 HP each scene → set to 1 HP; Immovable 1 round).

**Thunder Sapper:** Over-Prime (boost breach charge, 90–100 misfire), Shock Haft (melee crit pushes 1m; wall impact +1d4 blunt), **Capstone: Chain Det** (link two charges; resolves in sequence; Echo Attraction +10).

**Line Marshal:** Mesh Overwatch (remote trigger ward-mesh 10m), Fault Finder (mark span: allies +10 to breach; enemies −10 to shove you there), **Capstone: Seal Master (Mechanical)** (longer reinforcements; collapse TN −5 in 3m).

## Kit (v0.6a)
- Repeater Arbalest (6 bolts, burst/strafe options)
- 2× Breach Charge, 2× Firepot (Naphtha), 2× Shrapnel Can, 1× Smoke Pot
- 3× Tangle Line, Resin & Rivets (6 uses)
- 1× Ward-Mesh Plate, 1× Knot-Stone Plate, 1× Sunder Plate, 1× Keystone Brace
- 2× Mute-Line Chalk  
**Echo rule:** Blast pings echoes: base 30% (−10 per active Mute-Line; +10 per extra blast this round).

## Example Turn
1. **Set Plate** (Ward-Mesh) → **Seat Keystone** (TN 45) → **Seal & Rivet** (TN 50).  
2. Enter **Anvil Stance** covering the choke.  
3. Use **Repeater (burst2)** to suppress; if jam accumulates, **Clear Jam** (1 action).

## GM Tips
- Echo swarms are the balance lever: big noise draws attention unless the Stonewarden invests in Mute-Lines.  
- The dwarf is strongest in **short lanes** and **structured spaces**; in open fields he needs cover and time to set plates.  
- Keep “pre-inscribed” rule visible: male Stonewardens do not inscribe; they **deploy**.
