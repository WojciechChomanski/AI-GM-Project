# Archon Threll — Guildmaster of the Deep Holds

**Sigil:** Red Arc (Forge-Line)  
**Frame:** Thickset even for a dwarf; soot freckles; beard streaked white (Vow cracks).  
**Burden:** Two sons lost to echo-swarm lung-seal. Carries their broken ward-ropes at his belt.

## Motive
Threll believes the city survives only by burying what cannot be redeemed. Elara promised him three breath-vials “for his boys” if he ceded the Keystone Chamber at midnight. He bought it. Of course he did.

## Tells
- Thumb taps tools: one, two, three.  
- Will not look at children in the guildhall.  
- Quiets whenever the word **“Eli”** is spoken aloud.

## Levers
- **Debt stone:** His name sits in the ledger in pale chalk; he hates that it’s public.  
- **The Ropes:** Presenting the sons’ ropes with respect lowers his guard.  
- **The Vow:** He broke it once; the beard streak says so.

## If Confronted
- **Runecraft:** +10; **Willpower:** +15; **Mobility:** -5.  
- If the party mentions Mass of Repose, he spits: “Priests don’t hold walls. Stone does.”
