# Sister Mira Vey — Confessor (Deceased)
Version: 0.3 • Updated: 2025-09-30

**Role**: Confessor envoy lost after a parley with the Velvet Gallows.
**Fate**: Murdered by Elara Voss (strangled with her own rosary).
**Token**: A single **pearl** from her rosary; often carried warm.
**Status**: Breath preserved by Sister Asha in a labeled vial.

## Hooks
- The **pearl** serves as proof of death to Confessors or leverage with the Quartermaster.
- Returning **Mira’s breath** to Asha grants **Eden Clue #2**.
- Confessor rites may “re-seat” a shadow of Mira among the records.
