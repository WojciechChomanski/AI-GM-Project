# Elara Voss — Visit to the Deep Holds (Addendum)
Version: 0.3 • Updated: 2025-09-30

Barefoot and bleeding, Elara descended into the Deep Holds carrying a single pearl — warm, slick, and not a relic.
Sister Asha recognized it: the pearl belonged to **Mira Vey**, a Confessor sister who vanished after a “routine” parley
with the Velvet Gallows. Elara strangled Mira with her own rosary, took the pearl, and kept it warm between her thighs
on the way down.

**Why she came:** not for a breath, but for **absolution**. Asha asked, *“Do you regret it?”* Elara answered,
*“I regret getting caught.”* Asha broke — and yet returned the pearl, saying: *“Wear this. Let it remind you who you are.”*

> Twist: Asha never let **Mira’s breath** go free. It sits in a thin vial labeled: **“For the girl who thinks she’s clean.”**

## Consequences if the PCs deliver Mira’s Breath to Elara
1. **Submission Route** — Elara smiles, kisses you, whispers *“Thank you.”* → **Corruption +15**; flag: *Elara’s Favorite Pet*.
   She will kill for you, but your will is tied to hers.
2. **Fracture Route** — Elara breaks, sobs, then lunges with a blade. → **Velvet Gallows Reputation −2d10**; the **Quartermaster**
   (Theron’s widow) is alerted. If you **win**, she trades the **pearl** for a **Confessor seal**.

## Redemption Thread
If the PCs return **Mira’s breath** to **Asha**, Asha whispers: *“You just saved a ghost.”*
**Eden Clue #2** — *“The Tower’s heart beats in the Hollow Courts.”*
