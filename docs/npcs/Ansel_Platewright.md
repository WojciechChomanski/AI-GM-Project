# Ansel, the Platewright (v0.6b)

**Locale:** Blackhall – Lower Foundry Row  
**Vibe:** Patient, soot-streaked pragmatist. Speaks in short lines; hates sloppy seating.  
**Hooks:** Discounts for Stonewardens; side-eye for reckless Over-Prime.

## Services
- **Repair Plate:** 5 min / 1 silver per durability.
- **Seat Keystone:** 15 min / 8 silver (bench time).
- **Rivet Reseal:** 20 min / 10 silver (hybrids & collars).

## Restock
- **Daily 08:00:** 6 slots (common-weighted).
- **Weekly Monday:** 2 slots (rare/very rare).

## Table Tips
- If players hold a cut cleanly, Ansel throws a voucher (Seat & Rivet – 10s).
- If they botch a misfire at his door, he tacks on a 5% “bench hazard fee.”
