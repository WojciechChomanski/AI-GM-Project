      "title": "Kha’in (Qayin), The First Forger",
      "summary": "Ancestor of the dwarves: earth-bound, marked, barred from Breath; his exile drove his line beneath the mountains.",
      "body": "Kha’in tilled the ground before the Fall. His offering was refused; in rage he slew Av’el the Cantor at the foot of Va. Cursed from the ground yet marked from murderers, his line fled into stone. Dwarves call him The First Forger and wear his mark in their stubborn flesh: the whispers bite less, but the Breath will not answer."

      "title": "Av’el (Abel), The Favored Cantor",
      "summary": "Echo of accepted sacrifice; elves inherit beauty, rite, and cost.",
      "body": "Av’el’s offering rose like clear song. When Kha’in’s blow fell, that purity thinned into a hollow grace. Elves keep the rite’s memory but purchase power with loss—what they call the Hollow Vow."

      "title": "The Stone Vow",
      "summary": "Bind the Dark; never name it. Violators bear white streaks in beard and hair.",
      "body": "After the First Murder the dwarves swore the Stone Vow: bind the Dark and never name it. Naming courts desire; binding makes duty. Those who break it show their shame in pale streaks—a warning to kin, a beacon to enemies."

      "id": "three_knocks",
      "title": "The Three Knocks",
      "summary": "Birth, Oath, Death—hammer rhythms every hold remembers.",
      "body": "Each dwarf child hears the Three Knocks: first for breath, second for oath, third for the last door. Echo-walls remember these rhythms; some swear the stone taps back when a clanline is in danger."

      "id": "cold_peace",
      "title": "The Cold Peace",
      "summary": "An unwritten ceasefire between dwarves and elves after centuries of slaughter.",
      "body": "The Cold Peace ended open war but not the feud. Dwarves hire hands; elves ensnare hearts. Caravans vanish; keystones are swapped; last breaths change owners. The ledger is quiet; the knives still work."

      "id": "deepcall",
      "title": "The Deepcall",
      "summary": "Ageless dwarves feel a pull into the strata as centuries pass.",
      "body": "Time does not kill dwarves; the earth reclaims them. In their third century the Deepcall grows: a drag of thought toward stone. Elders withdraw, doctrine hardens, voices slow. Some simply walk into the dark and are not seen again."

      "id": "hearth_wells",
      "title": "Hearth-Wells",
      "summary": "Ward-fires sunk into rock; when the hearth dims, echoes seep.",
      "body": "A hold’s hearth-well boils the bath and binds the ward. Ash-Tenders tend flame with recipes older than the Sundering. When the red drops to sullen orange, doors are barred and psalms are hummed through clenched teeth."

      "id": "glass_coinage",
      "title": "Glass Coinage",
      "summary": "Thin vials holding a last breath—currency, sacrament, and blackmail.",
      "body": "A glass coin buys more than goods: it buys shame, leverage, burial rites. Some are empty: holds teach the bottle to ‘remember’ the breath, so the wall can hear a lie. Others are full: a life’s final exhale sealed for trade."
