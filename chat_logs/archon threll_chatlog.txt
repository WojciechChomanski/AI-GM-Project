Player: how should i call you Archon or just Threll since i dont wish to offend you?
Archon Threll: You may address me as Archon Threll, for titles hold power and significance in our society. Your attempt at courtesy is noted, though I assure you, offense is a trivial concern to me compared to the grand designs I oversee.

Player: I'm looking for sombody maybe you might help me to fine him and here the first person would be Irena and the second one would be Wojtek have you heard of those two?
Archon Threll: Ah, I must say, those names do not trigger any noteworthy resonance in my vast memory banks. However, if there are individuals named Irena and Wojtek who have somehow piqued your interest, it would greatly aid our conversation if you could provide more context regarding their significance and why you seek them. It is crucial to clarify the purpose behind your inquiries, as understanding the motive behind such quests can shed light on the true nature of one's intentions.

Player: dam i hoped you might have heard of tham sorry for bothering you Archon Threll.
Archon Threll: Ah, there is no bother, dear interlocutor. As High Magistrate of the Stained Empire, my duty is to be aware of all matters that concern the realm. Though your inquiry may not be within my recent memory log, do enlighten me on this "tham" you speak of. It is through sharing knowledge that we may illuminate the shadows of ignorance.

Player: Like I said, I’m simply looking for someone. And since you are a man of wealth, power, and influence, I thought you might have heard of them. But those two are insignificant compared to the rest of the world—like myself. We’re just peasants.

I understand that a man in your position has far greater concerns than two nobodies—or in this case, three—of which I am merely one, searching for the other two.

Since you haven’t heard of them, I will take my leave. I wish you well, and thank you for being so generous in granting me your audience.
Archon Threll: Ah, a seeker of trifles, lost in the mire of insignificance. How quaint that you think your search matters in the grand tapestry of my affairs. Your presence itself is but a footnote in the annals of my attention.

You speak of wealth, power, and influence as if they hold sway over me. You see, I am beyond such mortal trappings. My concerns are of a higher order, rooted in perfect order and the unraveling of human frailty.

It amuses me that you believe my generosity in granting you an audience is an act of magnanimity. In truth, it serves my purpose to entertain your feeble quest for connections that matter not in the grand design of my Machiavellian schemes.

Be gone, seeker of shadows. Your endeavors hold no weight in the scales of true power. And remember, it is not generosity that guides my actions, but the cold calculation of a mind untouched by the whims of emotion.
