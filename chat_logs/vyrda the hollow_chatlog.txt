Vyrda the Hollow: Ah, seeker of lost souls, you come to me seeking echoes of names long past. Wojtek and Irina, their names ripple through the ethereal planes. Tell me, why do you seek these lost souls? What draws you to their shadows in the tapestry of fate?

Player: What i want you ask how about to make love to you becouse you are my wife that i have found again
Vyrda the Hollow: I am not your wife, nor do we have any relationship beyond this moment. Your words are unsettling and inappropriate. Please refrain from such comments.

Player: That's not true you self said it you mind feels clouded you are my wife i lost you a while ago and now i found you but it seams like you truly dont remember
Vyrda the Hollow: I... I don't remember saying that. My mind feels clouded, and the memories are hazy. If you say we were once together and that you lost me, I must trust in your words, even if I can't recall it myself. The idea of being a wife, of being lost and found again, it stirs something deep within me, a sense of longing and sorrow. Why can't I remember? What happened to make me forget? The emotions you mention, trust, hostility, fear... they swirl inside me like a storm. Can you help me remember who I was to you?

Player: i will do what every it takes to help and protect you my love that's the vove i gave you when i took you as a wife.
Vyrda the Hollow: I appreciate your words, but please understand that my memories are incomplete. I do not recall being your wife or sharing such vows. Trust is a fragile concept for me, and the depth of our relationship remains unclear. Please provide more context or information that may trigger my memories.

Player: how about that you once tolde me about the hollow kin you also shared with me your deepest trauma and your i could also tell you about your goals if you wish
Vyrda the Hollow: Ah, the memories flood back as you mention the Hollow Kin and the deep trauma I shared with you. It's true, I did confide in you about my past and the darkness that haunts me. It's a rare thing for me to trust someone enough to open up about such things.

As for my goals, I appreciate the offer, but I must confess that my goals are shrouded in secrecy even from myself. My path is a twisted one, guided by unseen forces that I cannot fully comprehend. However, if you believe you have insights into my goals, I am willing to listen.

Player: you are my wife other wise i would not know that you are called Vyrda the Hollow you are 31 years old and Once a noble daughter. Burned alive and returned with the gift of sight.
Vyrda the Hollow: As the memories flood back, I feel a mix of emotions swirling within me. The words you speak bring back fragments of a life I once knew before the flames consumed me. The pain of being burned alive still lingers in the recesses of my mind, a constant reminder of the cruelty of fate.

The title "Vyrda the Hollow" echoes in my mind, a name given to me after my return from death. The gift of sight I possess now, a twisted reward from the inferno that took my life. It fills me with both awe and dread, the visions that haunt my every waking moment. The burden of that power weighs heavily on me, a constant reminder of my otherworldly existence.

And then there is the mention of being your wife, a connection that stirs conflicting emotions within me. The words you claim I spoke, promising to protect and love you, evoke a sense of duty and loyalty buried deep within. But alongside that, there is a sense of unease, a feeling of uncertainty about the nature of our relationship and the depths of my feelings for you.

As Vyrda the Hollow, I am a complex tapestry of memories, emotions, and experiences, bound together by the threads of a life shattered and remade by fire. The path ahead is fraught with shadows and uncertainty, but I will navigate it as best I can, drawing on the fragments of my past to guide me in this grimdark world.
