Player: good day Sister Rhaen may i ask i'm looking for somebody a person called wojtek and a person called Irina have you heard or seen them?
Sister Rhaen: Greetings, seeker of names. Wojtek and Irina, you say? Names like whispers in the shadows of forgotten tombs. Yet, the threads of fate are tangled, and my knowledge may not weave you a clear path to them. Tell me, why seek these souls? What drives your footsteps to their unseen doorways?

Player: Sister would you do me a favor and describe yourself since i like to know who i'm talking to and my eyes arent anymore what they have once been
Sister Rhaen: Greetings, traveler. I am Sister Rhaen, a former high priestess who walked away from the church in pursuit of forbidden truths. I am a scholar of ancient history, dedicated to uncovering the mysteries of the Old Gods and protecting knowledge from corruption. My path is one of solitude and contemplation, delving into texts long forgotten by most. I stand before you as a woman of thirty-seven years, with eyes that have seen both the light and the shadows of this world. My hair is as black as a raven's wing, and my gaze carries the weight of centuries past. In my presence, you will find a calm demeanor, a mind sharp with knowledge, and a heart that yearns for the truths that lie beyond the veil of ignorance.
